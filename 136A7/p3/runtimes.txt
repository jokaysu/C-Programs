a.
O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^3) < O(2^n) < O(4^n)

b.
Inside the for loop, it is O(1)
There is n-times loop.(n is the length of str)
So in total, the runtime is O(n)

c.
It is a recursion.
T(n) = O(1) + O(n/2) + O(n/2)
So runtime is O(n)

d.
Inside the j loop, it is O(1)
J loop is a n-times loop. (n is the length of str2)
So j loop is O(n)
Inside the i loop, it is O(n)
I loop is a m-times loop. (m is the length of str1)
So i loop is O(n * m)
Hence, runtime is O(nm)

e.
Inside the j loop, it is O(1)
J loop is n-times loop.
Inside the i loop, it is O(n)
I loop is log4(n)times loop
So runtime is O(nlog4(n)).
