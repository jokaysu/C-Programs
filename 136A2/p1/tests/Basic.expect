Hello,

This is a test to see if you can use the C printf function in CS 136.

Watch your spacing very carefully.
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can assume there are no spaces at the end of the lines.

One restriction: you cannot use numbers directly.

So, in order to print the fun number 1337 and 4010, you must use %d.

Also, please define:

const int n = 1337;

const int m = 4010;

And then use m and n (and %d) to print:
"The sum of 1337 and 4010 is 5347!".

Don't forget to put a newline (\n) at the end of the last line.
